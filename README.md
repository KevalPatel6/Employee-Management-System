## Description

This is a repository for a command line application that manages all company
personnel using an MySQL database to store all employee information. The application was created in order to allow
business owners the ability to view and manage departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they are able
to plan and organize the business as needed. As a software developer, from creating thsi application, I was able to
solidify my understanding of SQL queries to obtain the data I want to present. I was also, able to practice accessing
MySQL databases using JavaScript.

## Usage

In order to use this application, you will need to download the files in this repository into a single directory. Then, you will need to use the commandline to run the index.mjs file from the directory by using the command 'node index.mjs' When the file is executed, the command line will prompt the user to select from a list in the directory as to what they would like to do. The user will be able to View all departments, roles, and employees, add a role or employee to the database.

## Credits 

I want to give credit to my instructor Dane Edwards for helping me solve the issue of using the Database class with async await functions. I would also like to give credit to chat.openai.com for giving me answers to the questions I had regarding errors
